# Summary

The original works pretty well, but it's 2mm thick which is too much for my laptop. This one is slimmer, doesn't slide out of place as easily, has a better grip surface, and is way more flexible so glue it down way more thoroughly. Let me know if you like it!

# Print Settings

Printer Brand: Prusa
Printer: i3 MK2S
Rafts: Doesn't Matter
Supports: Doesn't Matter
Resolution: Better than 0.1mm
Infill: Doesn't matter, the shell will be thicker than the build volume

Notes: 
This is where your printer's maximum resolution will pay off. Also, print the slide piece right side up and the Frame upside down.
